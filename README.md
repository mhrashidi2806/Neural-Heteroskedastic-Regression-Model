# Neural-Heteroskedastic-Regression-Model
This project implements a neural heteroskedastic regression model, addressing cases where target variability depends on input data. It combines a normal probability density model with neural networks, using experiments.py for training, and nn_base.py and nn_mods.py for model design. Modify these files to experiment with different architectures.
